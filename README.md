# christmas-countdown
A Python script to count down the number of (whole) hours to Santa.

It took me somewhere in the region of five minutes to write this script to satisfy my kids, so it's not artistic or efficient. I've even hard-coded the year in it, so go ahead and change the year if you're from the future.
